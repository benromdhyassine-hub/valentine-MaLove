    <h1>My Love ❤️</h1>

    <p>
      From the very first moment we met, something inside me knew you were different.
Even when distance tried to test us, our love only grew stronger.
Through every call, every message, every moment together,
you became not just my love, but my home.

I don’t just want today with you.
I want every tomorrow.
Every dream.
Every adventure.
Every quiet moment.
W rabi ydawim 3ichritna w mwaditna w y5alik liya ❤️
Would you continue writing this beautiful story with me?
